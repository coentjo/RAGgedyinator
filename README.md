## 🤔 What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful AI technique that combines the best of both worlds:
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from knowledge bases
- **Generation**: Using AI to create contextual, informed responses

RAG enables AI systems to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and domain-specific answers by grounding their responses in retrieved knowledge.

👉 **[Read our comprehensive introduction](docs/introduction.md)** to dive deeper into RAG concepts, benefits, and real-world applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Python programming knowledge (intermediate level)
- Familiarity with APIs and data processing
